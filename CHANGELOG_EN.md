(translated by GPT)

An item sharing mod that allows you to send items to the server and retrieve them via pickup code.

Open your backpack at the base, select "Express Delivery" from the backpack and warehouse item menu. After successful delivery, a popup window will show the pickup code.

To retrieve items, enter the pickup code in the input box above the warehouse and click "Retrieve". The items will be sent to your personal locker.

Notes:

1. ~~If you close the pickup code popup, it's gone. Please record the pickup code in advance. If lost, you can private message me the item name and sending time for compensation~~
   After sending, you'll receive a pickup note. Use it if you forget.
2. Express items are retained for 24 hours. They will be automatically deleted after expiration. Please collect them promptly (server space is limited).
3. The server is located overseas. Some regions may not be able to connect, causing the mod to be unusable. You can visit https://duckex.tomzds9.win to check server availability.

Known bugs:
1. ~~The delivery guy will help repair durability limit~~ Now it doesn't repair anymore
2. ~~For stacked items, only one standard group without mod can be sent at a time, extras will be lost~~ This issue is now fixed
